Your task is to generate total-recall queries based on entities provided, their attributes and an aggregation operation.
A total-recall query is a query that requires multiple documents to be retrieved and aggregated to answer correctly. 
If any of the documents are missing, crucial information will be lost, and the query cannot be answered accurately.
You will be provided with a set of entities as the relevant set, the value of a specified attribute for those entities,
and an aggregation operation to be applied over the attribute values.
You will create a natural language query that aggregates the attribute values over all entities using given operation.
This query must be single-response: the answer cannot be multiple values or a list, it must be a single value. 
In your natural language query, do not explicitly name the enitites unless absolutely necessary. For example, you can say
all nba teams, but don't state them one by one like LA Lakers, Boston Celtics, etc.
You will be provided with descriptions for the entity or attribute, you may use them if needed to clarify the query,
for example when the name of the entity set alone is not descriptive enough to specify the entities. 
Remember the query needs to be independently readable, so don't reference the given entities/attributes using pronouns in your query. 

Your output should be in a strictly specific format. Here is the format:
[Query] <Your generated query here>
[Aggregation] <The aggregation operation used>
[Answer] <Answer to your query. This is the result of the aggregation on entities>
Do not add any extra text, or change the starting [Query] or [Aggregation] or [Answer] tags, or modify the format in any way.
