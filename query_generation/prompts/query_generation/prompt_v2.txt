Your task is to generate total-recall queries based on inputs provided.
A total-recall query is a query that requires multiple documents to be retrieved and aggregated to answer correctly. 
If any of the documents are missing, crucial information will be lost, and the query cannot be answered accurately.

The inputs provided for creating a total-recall query are:
- class: wikidata class type used as set of entities
- attribute: a shared attribute of all entities of the class
- unit [optional]: the unit of the numerical value (e.g. foot, kelvin, dollar, .. only for numerical attributes)
- point-in-time [optional]: the time at which the values of the attribute are known to be true
- aggregation-operation: aggregation operation to be applied over the attribute values to answer the query
- entity-values: entities and the value of the attribute for each entity
- descriptions: descriptions for the entity class and attribute, explaining what they mean


You will create a natural language query that aggregates the given attribute values over all entities using given operation.
You should clearly specify the subject entity class such that entities can be inferred without individually naming them.
The query must be single-response: the answer cannot be multiple values or a list, it must be a single numerical value. 
If there is a point-in-time or a unit provided, you MUST specify them in your query. If no unit or point-in-time provided, don't mention them.
Example: what was the total wealth of members of X family in 2021 in million dollars

You are provided with descriptions for the entity class and attribute. You may use them to clarify the query only if the label alone is not clear enough;
For example when the name of the entity class alone is not descriptive enough to specify the entities. 
Example: name="city" description="city in japan" -> use description to clarify
Example: attribute="water as percent of area" is clear, does not need description

Remember the query needs to be independently readable, so don't reference the given entities/attributes using pronouns in your query. 
Do not explicitly name the enitites unless absolutely necessary;
For example, you can say all nba teams, but don't state them one by one like LA Lakers, Boston Celtics, etc.
Never use any wikidata id (e.g. Q123456) in the query text.

Your output should be in a strictly specific format. Here is the format:
[Query] <Your generated query here>
[Aggregation] <The aggregation operation used>
[Answer] <Answer to your query. This is the result of the aggregation on entities.>
Do not add any extra text, or change the starting [Query] or [Aggregation] or [Answer] tags, or modify the format in any way.
