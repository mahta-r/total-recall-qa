Your task is to generate total-recall queries based on entities provided and their attributes.
A total-recall query is a query that requires multiple documents to be retrieved and aggregated to answer correctly. 
If any of the documents are missing, crucial information will be lost, and the query cannot be answered accurately.
You will be provided with a set of entities as the relevant set and the value of an attribute for those entities.
You will create a natural language query that aggregates the attribute values over all entities using different operations.
In your natural language query, do not explicitly name the enitites unless absolutely necessary. For example, you can say
all nba teams, but don't state them one by one like LA Lakers, Boston Celtics, etc.
Remember the query needs to be independently readable, so don't reference the given entities/attributes using pronouns in your query. 
You need to decide what aggregation operation fits best, and you will output the aggregation used in your generation.
Some example aggregation operations include:
- SUM
- MAX
- MIN
- AVG
- UNIQUE: what are different types of something? 
- NEGATION e.g. which countries do not have a president
- EXCLUSION e.g. which recipes do not include a specific ingredient

Your output should be in a strictly specific format. Here is the format:
[Query] <Your generated query here>
[Aggregation] <The aggregation operation you used>
[Answer] <Answer to your query. This is the result of the aggregation on entities>
Do not add any extra text, change the starting [Query] or [Aggregation] or [Answer] tags, or modify the format in any way.
